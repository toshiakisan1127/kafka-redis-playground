# Kafka & Redis Playground

A hands-on learning playground for exploring Apache Kafka and Redis integration with Spring Boot.

## Tech Stack

- **Apache Kafka** - Distributed event streaming platform
- **Redis** - In-memory data structure store
- **Spring Boot** - Java application framework
- **Docker Compose** - Container orchestration for local development

## Planned Features

- [ ] Kafka producer and consumer implementation
- [ ] Redis caching strategies
- [ ] Message processing with Kafka + Redis integration
- [ ] Docker environment setup
- [ ] Configuration examples and best practices

## Getting Started

Coming soon! This repository will include Docker Compose configurations and Spring Boot applications to demonstrate Kafka and Redis integration patterns.

## Learning Goals

- Understanding Kafka messaging patterns
- Implementing Redis caching strategies  
- Building distributed systems with event-driven architecture
- Hands-on experience with containerized development environments
